# WriXt

WriXt is a fork of [Writ CSS]("https://writ.cmcenroe.me/").

Simplistic, responsive, classless styles for semantic <abbr>HTML</abbr> with inbuilt dark mode support.

## Usage

Just copy the line below to the `head` tag of you HTML file

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://wrixt.hrst.in/wrixt.min.css">
```

or download the [full template here][template].

[template]: template.html

## Goals

These were the original goals of [writ](https://writ.cmcenroe.me/):

- Drop-in stylesheet
  - No classes
  - No extra elements
- Responsive, without special-casing
- Visually pleasing

They remain the same with wrixt.

## Motivation

WriXt was born by extending Writ to support dark mode. I implemented dark mode using the latest CSS function [`light-dark`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/light-dark).
		
The original motivation of Writ was this:

<abbr>HTML</abbr> is super easy to write. Markdown is even easier to write and
generate <abbr>HTML</abbr> from. But what does it look like?

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img alt="Default styles" width="285" src="screenshot/default.png">
</p>

Not very nice, and it gets worse the more there is. Applying the Writ
stylesheet makes it better.

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img alt="Writ styles" width="285" src="screenshot/writ.png">
</p>

## Caveats

Writ was designed for modern, standards compliant browsers only. Same goes for WriXt. I have used the very
new `light-dark` <abbr>CSS</abbr> function. So again, there are no
compatibility hacks. Some things might (should not, i guess) break.
